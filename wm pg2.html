<h3><p> A washing machine (laundry machine, clothes washer, washer, or simply wash) is a home appliance used to wash laundry. The term is mostly applied to machines that use water as opposed to dry cleaning (which uses alternative cleaning fluids and is performed by specialist businesses) or ultrasonic cleaners. The user adds laundry detergent, which is sold in liquid or powder form, to the wash water. A reliable washing machine is easily one of the most important household appliances you could own. Without a washing machine, doing laundry becomes a much more time-consuming and labor-intensive task. There are several washing machine features and benefits, and there are several brands of washing machines from which to choose.</p>
