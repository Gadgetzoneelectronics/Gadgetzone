<p> 
A refrigerator (fridge) is a commercial and home appliance consisting of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump (mechanical, electronic or chemical)<br> 
that transfers heat from its inside to its external environment so that its inside is cooled to a temperature below the room temperature.<br>
Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique around the world.<br>
The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage.<br> 
A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water.<br>
People put food and drinks in it, to keep those items cold or good (unspoiled) for a longer time.<br>
